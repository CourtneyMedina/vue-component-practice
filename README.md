# vue-component-practice
1) create a new vue project called like... vue-components-practice 
2) get rid of the hello world component 
3) then make a "Button" component  that accepts 4 props (text, type, className, and disabled) 
4) such that you can create a button by doing <Button className="btn btn-red" text="Home" type="button" />
5)  create 3 other buttons with one of them being disabled (Profile, Subscription, Log in)
